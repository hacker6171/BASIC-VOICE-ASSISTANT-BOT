## Basic Voice Assistant

**Description:**
This is a basic Python script designed to create a simple voice assistant capable of performing tasks such as playing music, providing information, and telling jokes.

**Dependencies:**
* `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech functionality
* `pywhatkit`: For playing music (currently commented out)
* `datetime`: For handling time-related tasks
* `wikipedia`: For accessing information
* `pyjokes`: For providing jokes
* `speech_recognition`: For speech input (assumed missing)

**Usage:**
* Ensure all required dependencies are installed (`pip install pyttsx3 pywhatkit datetime wikipedia pyjokes speech_recognition`)
* Run the Python script.
* Speak commands to interact with the assistant.

**Known Issues:**
* The project is currently under development and lacks full functionality.
* Error handling is minimal.

**Future Improvements:**
* Expand command recognition and responses.
* Implement more robust error handling.
* Enhance user interface and experience.
